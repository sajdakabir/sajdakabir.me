Two years ago, I didn't have any habits â€“ my life revolved around studying, scrolling through my mobile, and sleeping.

Now, I am a professional habit hopper. Every 3 to 4 months, I try to learn something new, and if I love that activity, it becomes my new habit.

One day during my internship, my supervisor asked me, "Hey Sajda, what is your hobby?" I was shocked to realize that I didn't do anything other than coding or trying to pass university semesters. That's when I thought, "Let's start a hobby so that if someone asks, I can say I have one."

As a developer, whenever you find a bug, you always search on Google. I did that to fix the bug in my life and discovered that an easy hobby is reading books.

I bought a book called "Atomic Habits," and thanks to that book, I am now so into new activities that I have mastered some cool new hobbies I never imagined I would.
